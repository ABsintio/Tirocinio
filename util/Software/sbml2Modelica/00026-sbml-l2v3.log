[2021-04-03T18:18:47.633] WARNING: The event event1 could change through an assignment the trigger of event event1. This could produce inconsistencies in the simulation, since if the two events are triggered and executed concurrently, one of them could change the trigger evaluation of the other. This will not be caught by the generated model.

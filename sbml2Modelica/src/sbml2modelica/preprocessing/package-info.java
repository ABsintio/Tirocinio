/**
 * This package contains a set of classes defining methods for pre-processing operations on
 * an SBML {@link org.sbml.jsbml.Model}.<br>
 * The pre-processing operation is needed since it transform the {@link org.sbml.jsbml.Model}
 * in some standard form which is much easier to handle when working with it.<br>
 * The pre-processing operation also examine the SBML {@link org.sbml.jsbml.Model} in order
 * to find the (possible) presence of some unsopported constructs.
